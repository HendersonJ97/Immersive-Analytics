This program requires both the HTC Vive head-mounted display and a set of Vive Controllers to be plugged into the computer used. Without them it will not work as intended.

To create your own instance of the program, please upload 'vrplot.html', 'generatescene.js', and 'cars.csv' to the same directory of a HTTPS-enabled web server, and then navigate to 'vrplot.html'.

To run the premade instance of the program, please navigate to https://hendersonj97.github.io/Immersive-Analytics/vrplot.html

Once on the page, press the button in the bottom right corner to enable VR.
Instructions for the controllers will be displayed above the relevant model.
